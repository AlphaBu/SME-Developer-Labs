### Creating a custom FFmpeg plug-in

This tutorial is designed to teach the fundamentals of the SDAccel development environment and programming model. This includes: familiarizing with OpenCL, understanding software and hardware emulation flows, profiling performance and identifying how to optimize host and kernel code. 

The kernel used in this tutorial is a 2D video filter, a function widely used in video processing algorithms such as noise reduction, and image sharpening. 

To simplify this tutorial, a workspace preloaded with the initial project configuration is provided in the lab repository.

Please also note that although the entire tutorial is performed on an F1 instance, only the final step of this tutorial really needs to be run on F1. All the interactive development, profiling and optimization steps would normally be performed on-premise or on a cost-effective AWS EC2 instance such as C4. However, to avoid switching from C4 to F1 instances during this tutorial, all the steps are performed on the F1 instance.

### Summary  

In this lab, you learned:
* Key features of the SDAccel development environment
* Important OpenCL API calls to communicate between the host and the FPGA
* The differences between the software and hardware emulation flows and how to run them
* How to read the various reports generated by SDAccel
* How to use pragmas to increase kernel performance
* How to use software pipelining to increase system performance
